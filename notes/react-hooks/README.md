# React Hooks Overview

1. **Defining React Hooks:** React Hooks are special functions designed for use in functional components.

2. **Use of "use" Prefix:** All hooks begin with the "use" prefix, including custom hooks.

3. **Enhancing Functional Components:** Hooks provide a way to add extra capabilities and business logic to functional components.

4. **Custom Hooks:** We make Custom hooks to reuse business logic that we repeat in different components, We can also use packages such as useHooks that contain many already-made custom hooks.

## Understanding the Concept of Hooks

1. **Hooking into React Functionalities:** React Hooks enable us to tap into React's core features and abilities.

2. **Business Logic Simplification:** Hooks help separate business logic from the UI, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

3. **Metaphor: Hooks as a Restaurant:**  React as a restaurant and hooks as a menu of options. Hooks API is the menu that simplifies the process of interacting with React features.

4. **Internal Details Abstraction:** Hooks allows developers to utilize React functionalities without needing to understand intricate internal workings.

## Using Hooks in Practice

1. **Rules of Hooks:**:
   - Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
   - Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
   - Hooks cannot be conditional.

2. **Custom Hooks Library - useHooks:** A library that contains many already-made custom hooks that we can use directly.
